            üëã Hello! I'm Engr. Florante G. Clavano Jr., a licensed electronics
            engineer who transitioned into the dynamic world of software
            engineering for three years now. With a strong foundation in
            electronics and a passion for technology, I've harnessed my skills
            to become a versatile software engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            üíª My toolkit includes a diverse set of technologies, such as
            Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Python Flask, Node.js,
            Express.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I thrive in developing web
            applications that provide intuitive and efficient solutions to
            real-world problems. üîß Whether it's designing user-friendly
            interfaces, optimizing back-end systems, or delving into data
            analysis, I enjoy the challenges that software engineering offers.
            My experience spans various domains, from front-end development with
            React to crafting robust RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, and
            managing data with MongoDB and PostgreSQL.{" "}
